# StonePi Project

This is a personal project that I have been tinkering with over time. It is to create a keychain Pi with:
* Zero device with a Waveshare 1.44" LCD display with buttons. 
  * ![Waveshare LCD](https://www.waveshare.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/800x800/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/1/_/1.44inch-lcd-hat-1.jpg)
* Low power cpu with male usb port.
  * ![PiZero USB](https://static.cytron.io/image/cache/catalog/products/RPI-USB-ADDON/RPI-USB-ADDON-800x800.jpg)   

## This case will provide a protective shell for the platform:

* Disk image designed to:
  * Monitor network traffic?
  * Packet Radio controller?
  * B.A.T.M.A.N. protocols?
  * Digital Wallet?
  * Have a menu set with quick deployment buttons to allow for lack of physical keyboard.
